# BoFs 2010

This year, [CUFP 2010](/2010/) has a new feature to bring industry and
academics together to promote real-world uses of functional
programming.

Birds of a Feather \(BoF\) sessions are for our community to gather
informally at CUFP and reach consensus on matters of importance.  Any
CUFP attendee can propose a BoF session, and grab one of the spare
rooms in the evening slots below.  Attendance in the evening is open
to all.

BoF sessions facilitate ad-hoc discussions and provide a place to
gather and start off the chat, before moving on during the evening to
a local restaurant or pub.

The table below lists all the spare rooms and available times.  To
propose a BoF, please mail Anil Madhavapeddy
\([avsm2@cam.ac.uk](mailto:avsm2@cam.ac.uk)\) with the following
information:

- Organiser contact name, email address and \(optionally\) cell phone
  number to get hold of you on the day.

- Which room number and day you wish to book.

- Number of attendees expected \(so we can make sure room capacity\).

- If you are willing to sponsor the BoF with some beer and snacks,
  that would also be appreciated, and you can include the sponsor's
  name.

If you just wish to attend a session, please also email Anil
Madhavapeddy \([avsm2@cam.ac.uk](mailto:avsm2@cam.ac.uk)\) and you
will be added to the attendee list so we can more easily account for
numbers.  You don't have to do this though; feel free to show up on
the day!

*Note:* the rooms are available from 1700 onwards, but the day's
workshops and tutorials only end around 1745, so most BOFs are
scheduled to start at 1800 onwards.
