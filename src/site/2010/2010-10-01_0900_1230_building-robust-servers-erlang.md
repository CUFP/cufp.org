## Abstract
The Building Robust Servers with Erlang tutorial will cover the
fundamental concepts needs to write highly fault tolerant servers with
Erlang/OTP. In this tutorial you will learn some OTP basics focusing
specifically on the `gen_server` and supervision behaviours. With these
behaviours you will build server that is capable of processing
requests rapidly and concurrently and recovering in the face of
failures large and small. You will ultimately build a fault tolerant
server, package it, and deploy it as a running service.

## Audience
Participants should bring basic Erlang knowledge.

## Software prerequisites
The prerequisites for this class are to have Erlang the Sinan build
system installed on your machine. If this is not possible for your OS
then at least Erlang itself should be installed.

Erlang is available here:

Sinan is available here:

## Martin Logan
has been heavily involved with the Erlang community since 1999.
Martin's great interest in distributed systems
and service based design has led him to be a constant presence in the
community having spoken many times all over the world on the topic in
places such as Canada, USA, Sweden, and the UK as well as author the
definitive book on the Erlang/OTP system with Manning publishing
entitled "Erlang and OTP in action". Martin has implemented many
complex systems that used Erlang in the telecom space including one of
the first call detail record collection systems for the SIP protocol.
Most recently Martin has focused on large scale e-commerce backing
systems. Currently Martin brings his expertise to Orbitz Worldwide,
one of the largest online travel companies in the world. Martin has
taken a leadership role with [Erlware](http://www.erlware.org/) where he is a core
developer and the primary developer of the Faxien package management
system.
