## Abstract
Earlier this year, Microsoft released Visual Studio 2010 with full support for the F# functional programming language.  In this talk, we will look at
what this meant, both technically and non-technically, and some of the interesting aspects of this "productization" of F#.  From ways that functional programming
languages can be positioned in the broader developer space, to issues like backwards compatibility, localization and tools scalability, we'll look at some of the
practical concerns facing functional programming languages in the commercial software development space.
