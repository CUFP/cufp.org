- title: T8: Network Programming in Clojure
- speakers: Zach Tellman
- affiliations: University of Cambridge

## Abstract
A typical Clojure server speaks HTTP, and uses a pure function to
model the request/response cycle. This aligns well with Clojure's
programming model, but it also hides away important details, and can
make the jump to a less structured protocol such as TCP or WebSockets
painful and error-prone.



## Tutorial objectives
This tutorial will build upwards from the fundamentals of network
programming, with an emphasis on practical analysis of each layer of
abstraction. By the end of the session, attendees can expect to have a
deeper, more nuanced understanding of how Clojure abstractions such as
core.async and Aleph can be used to create stable, fast,
well-understood servers.


## Target audience
The target audience for this tutorial is intermediate to advanced
Clojure developers. No prior experience with network programming is
required.
