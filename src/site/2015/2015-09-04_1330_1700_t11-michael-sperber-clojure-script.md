- speakers: Michael Sperber

## Abstract
Truly declarative GUIs have been an elusive dream for all functional
programmers. Instead, the state of the art in practical GUI
programming, even in functional languages, still relies on variations
of the MVC model where the program itself needs to align changes in
the model with changes in the GUI. This, and circular dependencies
between the view and the data, cause the universally hated "callback
hell." Facebook's React is frustratingly close to declarative, as it
renders the GUI via a pure function from the model. However, React's
idea of a model and its event event handling are still fundamentally
imperative. The Reacl framework, built on top of React, rectifies
this fault and provides purely functional management of rendering,
state and event handling to the ClojureScript programmer. This makes
Reacl a practical and efficient substrate for frontend programming
across almost all platforms: web, mobile, Java, and .NET. More
importantly, it makes GUI programming enjoyable again. Come and find
out how at this tutorial!
