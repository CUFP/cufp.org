- title: T9: A Tutorial on Verifying Higher-Order, Effectful Programs Using F\*
- speakers: Nikhil Swamy and Catalin Hritcu
- affiliations: Microsoft Research / INRIA Paris

## Abstract
F\* is a new ML-like programming language for verifying higher-order,
effectful programs. Specifications are expressed using refinement
types and pre- and post-conditions on computations, and the produced
verification conditions are discharged using an SMT solver. F\* has
been successfully used to verify a variety of programs, including the
security of cryptographic protocol implementations; authorization
properties of web browser extensions and cloud-hosted web
applications; memory invariants of a model of the JavaScript runtime;
and even the soundness of the F\* type-checker itself. The latest
version of F\* is programmed in F\*, bootstraps in both OCaml and F# on
all major platforms, and is open source.


## Tutorial objectives

This half-day tutorial will begin with a short introductory lecture on
F\*. The rest of the time will be spent working in smaller groups in
interactive mode, using the F\* tool to program and verify the
correctness of a number of small programs, including purely functional
and effectful programs, and some small security-oriented examples.
Depending on interest, we will also cover the use of F\* as a proof
assistant, showing how it can be used to mechanize the metatheory of
the simply-typed lambda calculus.

Infrastructure: We will use the [online tutorial and web editor for F\*](https://www.fstar-lang.org/tutorial/), so participants do not need to
install anything on their machines, but they need a working internet
connection. As a fallback, F\* binaries for various platforms and
source code are available at [GitHub]( https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar) and
can be downloaded and installed in advance.

## Target audience
Functional programmers with an interest (but not
necessarily experience) in formal verification.
