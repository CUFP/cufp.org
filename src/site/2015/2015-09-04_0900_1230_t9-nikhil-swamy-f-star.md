- title: T9: A Tutorial on Verifying Higher-Order, Effectful Programs Using F*
- speakers: Nikhil Swamy and Catalin Hritcu
- affiliations: University of Cambridge

## Abstract
F* is a new ML-like programming language for verifying higher-order,
effectful programs. Specifications are expressed using refinement
types and pre- and post-conditions on computations, and the produced
verification conditions are discharged using an SMT solver. F* has
been successfully used to verify a variety of programs, including the
security of cryptographic protocol implementations; authorization
properties of web browser extensions and cloud-hosted web
applications; memory invariants of a model of the JavaScript runtime;
and even the soundness of the F* type-checker itself. The latest
version of F* is programmed in F*, bootstraps in both OCaml and F# on
all major platforms, and is open source.

This half-day tutorial will begin with a short introductory lecture on
F*. The rest of the time will be spent working in smaller groups in
interactive mode, using the F* tool to program and verify the
correctness of a number of small programs, including purely functional
and effectful programs, and some small security-oriented examples.
Depending on interest, we will also cover the use of F* as a proof
assistant, showing how it can be used to mechanize the metatheory of
the simply-typed lambda calculus.

Infrastructure: We will use the online tutorial and web editor for F*
at https://www.fstar-lang.org/tutorial/, so participants do not need to
install anything on their machines, but they need a working internet
connection. As a fallback, F* binaries for various platforms and
source code are available at https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar and
can be downloaded and installed in advance.

This is joined work from:
Nikhil Swamy, Catalin Hritcu, Chantal Keller, Pierre-Yves Strub, Aseem
Rastogi, Antoine Delignat-Lavaud, Karthikeyan Bhargavan and Cédric
Fournet


## Tutorial objectives

Learn you some F*.
