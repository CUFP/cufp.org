# CUFP 2015 Call for Tutorials

Commercial Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) is an annual meeting
co-located with the International Conference on Functional Programming
which this year will take place in Vancouver, Canada on 3-5 September 2015.
CUFP aims to bridge the gap between academia and users applying
functional programming in practice. CUFP provides high-quality
practical tutorials covering state-of-the-art techniques and tools for
functional programming. There will be a mix of tutorials on
introduction and advanced level, such that anyone that wants to learn
something new has an opportunity to do so.

We are seeking proposals for half-day tutorials to be presented during
the first two days of the meeting, 3 and 4 September. Submission
deadline is April 30th, but the earlier you submit, the better!

Among the suggested topics for tutorials are:

* Introductions to functional programming languages. In the past we
  have had introductions to Clojure, Erlang, F#, Haskell, ML, OCaml,
  Scala, Scheme and others.

* Applying functional programming in particular areas, including the
  web, high-performance computing, finance.

* Tools and techniques supporting state of the art functional
  programming.

Tutorial proposals should address the following points:

* Title

* Abstract (about 100 words)

* Tutorial Objectives: by the end of this tutorial you will be able to …

* Intended audience: e.g. beginners, those with a working knowledge of X, …

* Speaker Bio: Joe Bloggs is ...

* Infrastructure required: For example, will participants need access
  to a particular system? Do they need to download anything prior to
  the tutorial? Can they be expected to have this on a laptop, or does
  it need to be provided by the meeting?

* Other minor information which will help us market your tutorial.

and should be submitted using the following [talk submission
form](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cufp2015).

If you have any questions, email Thomas Arts: thomas dot arts at
quviq dot com or Román González: romanandreg at gmail dot com

The 2015 conference is in Vancouver, Canada from September
3rd-5th. Once again, it is co-located with [ICFP
2015](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2015/).
