**Functional Programming** has been at the forefront of a new
generation of programming technologies, and companies have been
successfully utilizing functional programming to enable more flexible,
robust, and effective software development.

The annual CUFP workshop is designed to serve the growing community of
commercial users of functional programming. Practitioners meet and
collaborate, language designers and users share ideas about the future
of their languages, and experts share their expertise on practical
functional programming.

CUFP is co-located with [ICFP](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2015/)
and consists of three components: Talks, Tutorials and BoFs.

### <i class="fi-microphone"></i> Talks
###### Saturday September 5th
Tutorials will consist of a series of talks given by practitioners in
the field. The talks will be split between experience reports,
describing ways in which functional programming has been used, either
successfully or unsuccessfully, in the real world; and technical
talks, which will detail techniques and approaches for applying
functional programming in practical settings.

### <i class="flaticon-pen43"></i> BoFs
Birds-of-a-Feather sessions will consist of so-called
"birds-of-a-feather" sessions, which will create spaces for informal
conversations on a variety of topics. Among other things, this will be
a good venue for language designers and practitioners to exchange
ideas about the future of functional programming. As is typical with
BoFs, topics will be chosen beforehand based on a public process for
gathering proposals, organized via our website.
