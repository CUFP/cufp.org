## Abstract 

Lenses and prisms have taken on a bigger and bigger role in the Haskell community for dealing with problem spaces that I never anticipated when initially designing the lens library.

I'll talk about how lenses are prisms are being used to parse and deal with json, xml for all sorts of "CRUD" applications just as nicely as their "designed" goal of being able to work deeply nested structures.

Most of the examples will be in Haskell using lens, but we'll dip out to Scala here and there to see that there isn't anything particularly special about laziness and Haskell when it comes to finding uses for these ideas.
