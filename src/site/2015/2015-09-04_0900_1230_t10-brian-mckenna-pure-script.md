- speakers: Brian McKenna
- affiliations: University of Cambridge

## Abstract
PureScript is a small, typed, functional programming language which compiles to JavaScript. Some of the goals are to require no runtime by compiling to minimal JavaScript and to provide a simple Foreign Function Interface to interact with existing JavaScript. PureScript has seen some commercial adoption and has many libraries available for writing functional web front-ends.

This tutorial will cover writing an interactive web application using PureScript.


## Tutorial objectives

* Write a front-end web application using pure functions.
* Learn some of the many tools used for writing PureScript applications.
* Use the FFI to interact with existing JavaScript.


## Target audience
People with some experience in typed functional programming interested
in applying their skills to front-end development. Possibly useful to
people interested in finding out how to express front-ends as pure
functions.
