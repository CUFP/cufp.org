## Abstract 

LiveHelpNow, a support service company, uses a VB.NET/WebForms-oriented stack, which is further becoming more difficult to maintain. After an extended research period, the company settled on migrating to Elixir/Erlang as a long-term goal. At the time, Elixir was still in its infancy, but the developers felt Erlang was a great match for the nature of their service, despite what was considered to be poor support for communicating with Microsoft SQL Server, and despite having little development experience in a functional paradigm. They felt the benefits of Elixir/Erlang outweighed the costs of developing a new database driver. In this talk, Justin will discuss his experience building a binary protocol driver to the Tabular Data Stream(TDS) specification in Elixir and, more generally, on using Elixir in production.
