## Abstract 

It is increasingly common to see the construction of declarative systems expressed through data and driven by functional programming languages. This work takes a step beyond Embedded Domain Specific Languages (EDSLs) and leverages the compositional nature of data to create an extensible, language-agnostic expression of intent. Such systems can radically simplify business processing, service creation and orchestration, and even front-end application development.

This talk will analyze and discuss the design principles, quality attributes, and trade-offs of data-driven, declarative systems. Best-practices in successfully applying these techniques will be shared - providing the audience with tips in creating similar systems of their own. To motivate the topic, we will walk through a Consumer Reports' pilot project that utilized this approach to develop ETL tooling, web services, and rich-client applications - all with Clojure and ClojureScript.
