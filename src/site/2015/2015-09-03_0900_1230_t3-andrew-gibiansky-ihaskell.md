## Abstract
IHaskell provides a modern exploratory programming environment for
Haskell, functioning as a browser-based replacement for GHCi and
allowing for rich displays (HTML, LaTeX, images and videos, etc) as
well as interactive visualizations. When properly used, interactivity
can be a huge boost to development, drastically reducing the coding
feedback cycle.


## Tutorial objectives
By the end of this tutorial, we will cover what IHaskell is and how to
use it, the software architecture it is built on, and most importantly
how you can use IHaskell with your own libraries, DSLs, and
languages. We'll have several hands-on examples of how libraries and
languages can be integrated with IHaskell, and how the resulting
interactivity and quick feedback loop can accelerate development.


## Target audience
Proficient Haskell programmers (no deep expertise is needed, but
proficiency is assumed), with an interest in interactive computing
(whether for data analysis or anything else).
