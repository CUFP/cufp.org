## Abstract
Erlang started life nearly thirty years ago as part of an
effort to find more effective ways of developing highly concurrent,
highly reliable telecommunications systems. Fortunately, we've found
that its concurrency and reliability capabilities are just as valuable
in other domains as well, especially web development. This tutorial
will explore several Erlang web servers, including Yaws and Mochiweb,
and will examine the Nitrogen, Webmachine, and Chicago Boss Erlang web
frameworks. Each web server and framework provides different features
and capabilities, allowing them to address  different portions of the
vast web development landscape.

## Prerequisites
Attendees should possess a basic knowledge of HTTP,
HTML, and JSON. Some prior knowledge of Erlang is preferred but not
required. Attendees should bring a laptop in order to participate in
hands-on coding exercises. Instructions for loading Erlang and other
software will be sent to attendees prior to the tutorial.

## Goals
Participants will gain deeper knowledge of the basics of Erlang
web development, will learn how to use specific features of different
Erlang web servers and frameworks, and acquire a better understanding
of which servers and frameworks to apply to different kinds of web
development problems.

Please bring a laptop to the tutorial. Ideally, you should install the
required software on your laptop *before the tutorial*. If that fails,
we'll have a machine on-site for you to connect to.  In that case,
make sure to have an
[RDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol) client \(a
client for Microsoft's Remote Desktop protocol\) installed on your
laptop, so you can connect to our on-site machine.

If you have problems or questions, please contact Mike Sperber \(sperber\(at\)deinprogramm\(dot\)de\).

### Installing the prerequisite software
For this tutorial, you should have Unix/Linux/Mac OS X on your laptop.  If that's not possible, see above.

+     First, install Erlang/OTP 15B01 from [this page](http://www.erlang.org/download.html).

+     Download [this file](/sites/all/files/uploads/erlang-web.tar.gz) and untar it somewhere on your machine.
