- title: T3: Haskell for the lazy web developer: an Introduction to Happstack
- speakers: Jeremy Shaw

## Abstract
In this hands-on workshop, participants will develop a simple web
application from start to finish using the Happstack Haskell Web
Framework.

## Content
Participants will leave this workshop confident that using Haskell for
web development is not merely possible, but a really good idea. We
will explore, in a hands-on and practical manner, how features of
Haskell such as the type-system, purity, and first class functions
make it easier to build fast, safe, and scalable web applications.

## Prerequisites
It is expected that participants will have a basic grasp of Haskell.
Understanding the material covered in [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) or [Real
World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/) should be more than sufficient. Individuals with out
Haskell experience may still find the introductory presentation
informative and inspiring.

## Preparation
Please bring a laptop to the tutorial. Ideally, you should install the required software on your laptop *before the tutorial*. If that fails, we'll have a machine on-site for you to connect to.  In that case, make sure to have an [RDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol) client \(a client for Microsoft's Remote Desktop protocol\) installed on your laptop, so you can connect to our on-site machine.

If you have problems or questions, please contact Mike Sperber \(sperber\(at\)deinprogramm\(dot\)de\).

### Installing the prerequisite software
+     First, download and install the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/).

+     Run the following commands:


<pre>
cabal update
cabal install happstack-foundation
</pre>
