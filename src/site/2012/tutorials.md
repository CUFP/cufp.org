# CUFP 2012 Tutorials

This year CUFP is putting on a series of longer tutorials to introduce
functional programming languages in depth, in particular F#, Scala and
Haskell. In addition there are advanced tutorials on special
topics. Details below.

The CUFP tutorials run September 13th-14th, in Copenhagen,
Denmark. The CUFP tutorials are associated with the main CUFP
conference the following day.

## Introductory Tutorials on Scala, F\#, Haskell
These tutorials are intended for people mostly new to functional
programming, and will give in-depth training on the language. They are
each presented by renowned top-notch experts on the language.

These introductory tutorials all go for a full day, and in the case of
Haskell, for *two days*.

### Introductory Haskell / Concurrent Haskell
- [Full
  details...](/2012/introductory-haskell-concurrent-haskell-jeremy-gib-day1.html)

This two-day tutorial is designed to introduce you to Haskell without
assuming that you know anything about the language in advance, and
will introduce you to the underlying ideas and concepts of Haskell as
well as giving you hands-on experience of programming in Haskell. Day
2 will cover further practical aspects of day-to-day programming in
Haskell, with a particular focus on concurrency.

It is taught by Jeremy Gibbons \(University of Oxford\) and Simon
Marlow \(Microsoft Research\).

### From functional concepts to real-world F\#.
- [Full
  details...](/2012/functional-concepts-real-world-f-tomas-petricek-un.html)

This practical tutorial will teach you how to turn to the functional
side. It will slowly introduce functional concepts by looking how the
same concepts would look in an object-oriented style. You'll
understand how functional programming works under the cover and you'll
get some hands-on experience of using F# to solve some practical
problems. The examples will include concurrent programming and data
analysis tasks.

It is presented by Tomas Petricek \(University of Cambridge\)

### Scala Primer
- [Full details...](/2012/scala-primer-heiko-seeberger-typesafe.html)

This tutorial will introduce you to Scala. It is intended to enable
experienced developers to confidently start programming in Scala. No
previous knowledge of Scala is assumed. Although intense, the course
ensures you will have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of the
language and the tooling.

It is presented by Heiko Seeberger \(Typesafe\).

## Advanced Tutorials
There will also be in-depth technical tutorials for attendees already
familiar with a functional language:

- [T2: Erlang web
  frameworks](/2012/t2-erlang-web-frameworks-steve-vinoski-basho-techn.html)

- [T3: Haskell for the lazy web developer: an Introduction to
  Happstack](/2012/t3-haskell-lazy-web-developer-introduction-happsta.html)

- [T4: Hands on Real-World
  Clojure](/2012/t4-hands-real-world-clojure-lau-jensen-best-class-.html)
