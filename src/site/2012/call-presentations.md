# CUFP 2012: Call for Presentations

**Workshop for<br />
Commercial Users of Functional Programming 2012<br />
Sponsored by SIGPLAN<br />
[CUFP 2012](http://cufp.org/conference.html)<br />
Co-located with [ICFP 2012](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2012/)<br />
Copenhagen, Denmark<br />
Sep 13-15<br />
Talk Proposal Submission Deadline 29 June 2012**
</div>

The annual CUFP workshop is a place where people can see how others
are using functional programming to solve real world problems; where
practitioners meet and collaborate; where language designers and users
can share ideas about the future of their favorite language; and where
one can learn practical techniques and approaches for putting
functional programming to work.

## Giving a CUFP Talk
If you have experience using functional languages in a practical
setting, we invite you to submit a proposal to give a talk at the
workshop.  We're looking for two kinds of talks:

**Experience reports** are typically 25 minutes long, and aim to
inform participants about how functional programming plays out in
real-world applications, focusing especially on lessons learned and
insights gained. Experience reports don't need to be highly technical;
reflections on the commercial, management, or software engineering
aspects are, if anything, more important.

**Technical talks** are also 25 minutes long, and should focus on
teaching the audience something about a particular technique or
methodology, from the point of view of someone who has seen it play
out in practice.  These talks could cover anything from techniques for
building functional concurrent applications, to managing dynamic
reconfigurations, to design recipes for using types effectively in
large-scale applications.  While these talks will often be based on a
particular language, they should be accessible to a broad range of
programmers.

If you are interested in offering a talk, or nominating someone to do
so, send an e-mail to sperber\(at\)deinprogramm\(dot\)de or
avsm2\(at\)cl\(dot\)cam\(dot\)ac\(dot\)uk **by 29 June 2012** with a
short description of what you'd like to talk about or what you think
your nominee should give a talk about. Such descriptions should be
about one page long.

There will be a short scribes report of the presentations and
discussions but not of the details of individual talks, as the meeting
is intended to be more a discussion forum than a technical
interchange.  *You do not need to submit a paper*, just a proposal for
your talk! Note that we will need all presenters to register for the
CUFP workshop and travel to Copenhagen at their own expense.

## <a name="guidance"></a>Guidance on giving a great CUFP talk
**Focus on the interesting bits**: Think about what will distinguish
your talk, and what will engage the audience, and focus there.  There
are a number of places to look for those interesting bits.

+ **Setting**: FP is pretty well established in some areas, including
  formal verification, financial processing and server-side
  web-services.  An unusual setting can be a source of interest.  If
  you're deploying FP-based mobile UIs or building servers on oil
  rigs, then the challenges of that scenario are worth focusing on.
  Did FP help or hinder in adapting to the setting?

+ **Technology**: The CUFP audience is hungry to learn about how FP
   techniques work in practice.  What design patterns have you
   applied, and to what areas? Did you use functional reactive
   programming for user interfaces, or DSLs for playing chess, or
   fault-tolerant actors for large scale geological data processing?
   Teach us something about the techniques you used, and why we should
   consider using them ourselves.

+ **Getting things done**: How did you deal with large software
  development in the absence of a myriad of pre-existing support that
  are often expected in larger commercial environments \(IDEs,
  coverage tools, debuggers, profilers\) and without larger, proven
  bodies of libraries? Did you hit any brick walls that required
  support from the community?

+ **Don't just be a cheerleader**: It's easy to write a rah-rah talk
  about how well FP worked for you, but CUFP is more interesting when
  the talks also spend time on what *doesn't* work.  Even when the
  results were all great, you should spend more time on the challenges
  along the way than on the parts that went smoothly.
