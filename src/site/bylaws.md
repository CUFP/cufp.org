## Goals of CUFP
The goal of CUFP is to build a community of users of functional
programming languages and technology, regardless of whether community
members use functional languages in their professional lives, in an
open source project \(other than in the implementation of functional
languages\), as a hobby, or any combination thereof. In short: anyone
who uses functional programming as a means, not an end.

CUFP aims to help functional programming become increasingly viable as
a technology for use in the commercial, industrial, and government
space by providing a forum for FP professionals to share their
experiences and ideas, whether business, management, or
engineering. It also aims to enable the formation and cementing of
relationships and alliances that further the commercial use of
functional languages. Providing user feedback to language designers
and implementers is not a primary goal of CUFP, though it will be
welcome if it occurs.

## Annual Meeting
In pursuit of this goal, CUFP holds an annual meeting at which people
present their stories of how functional programming has worked \(or
not!\) for them. The meeting may also include tutorials and other
content aimed at helping users of functional programming
languages. The program for the meeting is put together by a program
committee, typically chaired by two people, serving staggered two-year
terms. It is the responsibility of the program chairs to form a
program committee with the consultation and approval of the CUFP
Board/SC and the SIGPLAN Chair and Vice Chair to secure continued
SIGPLAN sponsorship.

## Steering Committee
The steering committee is responsible for setting the long-term
direction of CUFP, both for the annual meeting and for any other
activities deemed to forward the goals of CUFP. The chair of the
steering committee serves a two-year term. The steering committee is
comprised of the following:

- The four most recent program committee co-chairs \(starting as soon
  as a person agrees to be a program committee co-chair\)

- Four members-at-large \(serving 4-year terms, one turning over at
  CUFP each year\)

- In years in which a new steering committee chair has been elected,
  the previous steering committee chair remains a member of the
  committee for continuity

Each year the steering committee will meet and take the following
actions to renew its membership:

- If the steering committee chair has completed their term, a new
  steering committee chair is elected, typically from among the other
  members of the committee. The now prior steering committee chair
  remains a member of the committee for a year to ensure
  continuity. If the steering committee chair is continuing in their
  role, then the prior chair retires from the committee unless they
  also serve in some other role.

- Elect new program committee co-chairs, typically two, retaining the
  most recently elected program committee co-chair for continuity and
  choosing a new co-chair. The four most recently elected co-chairs
  now serve on the steering committee. Prior holders of that role
  retire from the committee unless they continue to serve in some
  other role.

- Elect a new member-at-large who is not otherwise serving on the
  committee. The four most recently elected members-at-large now serve
  on the steering committee. Prior holders of that role retire from
  the committee unless they continue to serve in some other role.

New steering committee members should be chosen to ensure
representation on the steering committee of the breadth of the CUFP
community. Diversity factors include those under the [SIGPLAN
diversity policy](http://www.sigplan.org/DiversityPolicy.htm). In
addition, we strive to include people from a variety of industries and
using a variety of functional programming languages. In the event that
someone is unable to serve to the completion of his or her term, the
steering committee will appoint someone to fill the vacancy.
