## Abstract
Mathematica is probably one of the most expressive functional
languages available. But since Mathematica holds all data in-core, it
has been challenging to use it on extremely large datasets. The
HadoopLink package is one part of a new effort at Wolfram to
circumvent this in-core limitation, by linking Mathematica with your
Hadoop cluster.  After a brief introduction to functional programming
in Mathematica, I'll walk through a simple example showing how to
write Map/Reduce jobs using Mathematica and HadoopLink. I'll then
describe a novel genome search algorithm written specifically for
Hadoop, taking advantage of Mathematica's expressive functional
constructs.


## Paul-Jean Letourneau
is a full-stack data scientist at Wolfram, working on technology
applications ranging from genomics to web analytics. He has been on
the faculty of the Wolfram Science Summer School since 2005, where he
teaches practical functional programming in Mathematica to students
who want to explore new frontiers in the computational
universe. Paul-Jean is currently writing in-house tools for working
with Hadoop and HBase using Mathematica.
