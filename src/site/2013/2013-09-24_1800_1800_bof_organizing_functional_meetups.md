- title: BoF: Organizing Functional Meetups
- speakers: Gershom Bazerman


Many of us organize functional language meetup groups, some of which
are more functional as meetup groups than others. Others would like to
organize functional meetup groups, but are perhaps not sure where to
start. This Birds of a Feather is for organizers, would-be organizers,
and interested others to share experiences, discussing what has worked
for us, what has not.
