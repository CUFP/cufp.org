## Abstract

As a global leader in digital and mobile advertising revenue products
and services, OpenX serves ads for many thousands of companies. At
peak times, the OpenX Market \(a pioneering Real-Time Bidding
exchange\) alone receives over 1 million bids per second. An
additional challenge is that ads must be served in just a few hundred
milliseconds. In 2012 OpenX served nearly 3 trillion ads, a near 200%
growth from the 1 trillion the Company served in 2011\. In order to
scale and support this rapid growth OpenX has leveraged Erlang in many
parts of its serving stack.  However, when first introduced there was
only one Erlang developer on staff, and a majority of the system was
written in PHP and Java.  This talk will discuss the challenges behind
introducing a functional programming language into a company, and how
those challenges were overcome with the use of several open source
tools.

## Anthony Molinaro
has been developing large-scale distributed systems since the late 90s
in many languages and environments. First at Goto.com, a pioneering
company in search advertising, where he helped to develop many of the
core serving pieces in Java, C and Perl. After Goto.com changed its
name to Overture.com and was acquired by Yahoo!, Anthony spent 5 years
working on the content match advertising system written in C. Upon
leaving Yahoo! in 2008 he joined a small startup that used Erlang
exclusively and extensively. Later in 2009, Anthony was hired by OpenX
where he has since introduced Erlang and spearheaded its use across a
large portion of OpenX‚Äôs Global Digital Revenue Platform.
