- speakers: Dean Wampler

## Abstract
Scalding is a Scala Domain Specific Languages (DSL) for Cascading, a
widely-used Java API for data analysis in Hadoop clusters. Cascading
provides higher-level data flow abstractions that hide many of the
low-level complexities of Hadoop’s Java API, thereby accelerating
application development. Scalding exploits the functional-programming
features and elegant DSL support in Scala to allow developers to write
concise Cascading programs with a syntax that fits data analysis and
transformation in a natural way. In fact, Scalding has the same
purpose-built feel for general data analysis and transforms that SQL
has for queries. Scalding is comparable to Cascalog, a Clojure-based
DSL for Cascading.  This hands-on workshop introduces Scalding using
examples of typical data analysis problems. Scala syntax is explained
as needed. We’ll briefly compare Scalding to other high-level language
options in common use, such as Hive and Pig. We’ll also see how
functional-programming idioms are a natural fit for working with
data. In fact, you can argue that SQL is a limited form of Functional
Programming. In my view, analytics is an underappreciated “killer app”
for the mainstream adoption of functional programming.

## Preparations
Go to the [GitHub
page](https://github.com/deanwampler/scalding-workshop) for this
tutorial and follow the instructions shown in the README, which tells
you how to install the required tools: Git, Java, Scala, and the Scala
build tool, sbt. \(Even if you already have them installed, make sure
you have the recent versions described in the README.\) Please
complete these steps in advance so we don't have to spend class time
doing them.
