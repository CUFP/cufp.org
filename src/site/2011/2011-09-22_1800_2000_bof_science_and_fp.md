*Topic*: Like commercial users of FP, scientists mostly just want to
get their jobs done. Those jobs include

- orchestrating heterogeneous and parallel computations and
  experiments
- tracking and reproducing the provenance of massive data sets
- coping with uncertainties in observations and specifications
- adapting to changes in algorithms and requirements
- organizing and explaining the conclusions of research

Come to discuss how science and FP should offer each other concrete
challenges and applicable abstractions.
