## Abstract
I'm Co-Founder &amp; CTO at 'hover.in', the in-text content &amp; ad delivery platform that let's blogs and website publishers to push client-side events to the cloud. The start-up predominantly runs off the LYME stack \( Linux / Yaws / Mnesia / Erlang \) .

From our experiences at 'hover.in' I'd like to discuss why we chose using Erlang and got about using it as our bridge across our multi-node cluster. In particular the architectural decisions that went into making our distributed python crawler back-end running off Mnesia with its sharing &amp; fragmentation strategies for tables that span several millions of rows, load-balancing to our 3-node Yaws web servers, tweaks to solve file descriptor &amp; efficiency bottlenecks, experiments in DHT's, our cache worker implementations, our messaging queues, cron's &amp; trade offs in dispatching jobs also throw light on design choices that can fit in distributed and heterogeneous environments. We have also recently built our own in-memory cache workers, persistent stats &amp; logging system, and in the process of now building our own A/B testing framework, that we'd love to talk about.

After an initial quite 1 1/2 years of Erlang in production, we've just launched our developer blog which might give a closer insight of our work:

- notes on our [multi-core computing & back-end experiences](http://developers.hover.in/blog/2009/somethings-to-rejoice-about/)
- notes on [using a Erlang based load-testing tool (Tsung)](http://developers.hover.in/blog/2009/yui-tsung-to-choose-a-cdn/)
- my talk on ['Erlang at hover.in'](http://www.slideshare.net/bosky101/erlang-at-hoverin-devcamp-blr-09) at devCamp Bangalore (with one slide listing all the modules written as well)
- [a more product-oriented interview](http://punetech.com/enrich-your-website-with-content-money-an-interview-with-hoverin/)
