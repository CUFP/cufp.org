## Abstract 

Over the past year, functional languages have seen a continued growth
in usage with more and more enterprises using them as part of regular
line of business applications. The games industry traditionally uses
an older range of tools with varied results. Even for small projects,
many will claim that native code is a requirement for performance.
Over the past year Blue Yolk Studios has been trying to make a better
game engine for medium to large scale mobile, console and PC games.

This session covers the journey from an initial implementation through
to the current architecture. Performance, multi device compatibility
and ease of use were all considerations throughout the development
leading to the ultimate consideration of whether functional
programming has a use at all in the future of game development.
