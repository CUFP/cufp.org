## Abstract 

MBrace is an open source framework for large-scale distributed
computation and data processing written in F#. It introduces a new
programming model for declaring computation based on monads (a.k.a.
computation expressions) and managing distributed data. The MBrace
framework is an elastic, fault tolerant and multitasking cluster
infrastructure that can be deployed to cloud services like Windows
Azure. MBrace provides tooling that allows seamless, REPL-style
submission of computation directly from the IDE.

In this talk, we will be focusing on the MBrace programming model,
showcasing its foundations and how they compare in expressive power
with respect to other established distribution abstractions. We will
be offering benchmarks and if circumstance allows, a short demo.
