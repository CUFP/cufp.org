- speakers: Evan Czaplicki, Spiros Eliopoulos

## Abstract
Elm began as an exploration of what “purely functional graphics
programming” would look like, and has since grown into a practical
language for front-end programming that is pure, functional, and
statically-typed. This tutorial will cover the key concepts and
features of Elm including declarative graphics, functional reactive
programming, extensible records, and JavaScript interop. This will
explain what “functional front-end programming” really means and how
to do it in Elm.

## Tutorial objectives
We have three main conceptual objectives:

* Understand FRP - core concepts and how to use them in practice

* Understand the architecture of a functional GUI - structuring code,
  how the renderer works, useful patterns, etc.

* Understand extensible records - explore the many tricks made
  possible by this Elm is designed so that it can be embedded in any
  app so you can introduce it incrementally, so by the end of this
  tutorial, you will be prepared to use Elm in your own project.

## Target audience
The target audience is commercial users who would like to use a
functional approach on the front-end. Whether you are frustrated with
JS or just exploring alternative approaches, you will get a lot out of
this. It is also valuable for academics interested in seeing FP used
to solve a very real practical problem.

This tutorial requires the Elm Platform, the elm-d3 source code, and a
modern web browser. Documentation of the process can be found here:
https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform/blob/master/README.md#elm-platform. The
elm-d3 source code is available via GitHub:

Evan Czaplicki is a functional programmer at heart, and his broad goal is to provide the tools and learning resources to make functional languages common in industry. He works full-time to develop Elm’s compiler, tools, and community to make it a great choice for web and cross-platform projects.

## Spiros Eliopoulos
Spiros Eliopoulos is a research engineer at Cornell
University, serving as Lead Engineer on the Frenetic controller
platform for Software-Defined Networks. He’s the author of the elm-d3
library that provides Elm bindings to the D3 JavaScript
library. Previously, he was the founding CEO of Tracelytics, a
SaaS-based Application Performance Management company built on top of
the X-Trace distributed tracing framework. He resides in Brooklyn, via
