- title: F# in Social Gaming
- speakers: Yan Cui

## Abstract 

Over the past couple of years we have seen F# gradually being adopted
across the software industry. Whilst that adoption has been largely
centred around the financial industry, F# on its own is an incredibly
versatile and expressive language and enables you to solve a wide
array of problems succinctly and efficiently.

This talk illustrates, with real examples, how the GameSys social team
is using F# to build the backend services that supports around 1
million Daily Active Users (DAU) across its social games on both
mobile and web platforms.

The goal of this talk is to demonstrate the use of F# to write clean,
concise game logic as well as infrastructure code, the same techniques
and concepts can be easily applied to other domains.
