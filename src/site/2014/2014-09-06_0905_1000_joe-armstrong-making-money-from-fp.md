## Abstract 

I believe that FPLs provide companies with a competitive advantage
that can be used to out-compete companies using non FPLs. But life is
not simple, in order to turn our ideas into money we can't just go and
explain our latest fancy type systems to a venture capitalist and
expect money to rain out of the sky - we have to do a lot more things.

In my talk, I'll talk about the "other things" that have to be done to
get FP established and to earn money from the technology.

Spoiler: The 19$B WhatsApp acquisition by Facebook shows that not only
can FP ideas earn money - but actually earn more money than in any
other acquisition to date (WhatsApp messaging is programmed in Erlang :-)
