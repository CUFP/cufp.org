- type: talk
- title: Haskell tools for satellite operations
- speakers: Björn Buckwalter
- session: Functional programming in space!

## Abstract 

Since 2013-04 the presenter has been supporting SSC (the Swedish
Space Corporation) in operating the telecommunications satellite
“Sirius 3” from its Mission Control Center in Kiruna. Functions in the
satellite vendor's operations software are breaking down as the orbit
of the ageing satellite degrades. To fill in the gaps in software
capabilities the presenter has developed several operational tools
using Haskell.

The talk will give an overview of the satellite operations
environment, the tools developed in Haskell, how they benefitted (and
occasionally suffered) from the choice of implementation language,
which (public) libraries were critical to their success, and how they
were deployed in the satellite operations environment.
