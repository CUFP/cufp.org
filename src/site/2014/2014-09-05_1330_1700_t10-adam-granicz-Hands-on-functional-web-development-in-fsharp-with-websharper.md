- title: T10: Hands-on Functional Web Development in F# with WebSharper
- speakers: Adam Granicz
- affiliations: IntelliFactory

## Abstract
WebSharper is a mature, open source web framework for developing
enterprise-grade F# web and mobile web applications. In this talk I
will demonstrate how it accommodates standards-based web development;
what robust, composable and sound functional programming abstractions
it has for modeling user interfaces, web forms, safe URLs, and even
entire web applications as F# values; and how its uniform,
single-language development model makes writing client-server
applications easy, fun, and robust.

## Tutorial objectives
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to create basic
WebSharper applications in F# that connect to databases, fetch input
from end users, and show results in client-side charts and
visualizations. You will not have to write a single line of
JavaScript, and you will appreciate the elegance, cleanness, and
robustness of F# and functional programming to build real-life web
applications.

## Target audience
Basic knowledge of F# is recommended, but not strictly needed.

Either Visual Studio with the latest version of WebSharper (via
http://websharper.com) installed into it, or the latest CloudSharper
Local installed (via http://cloudsharper.com).
