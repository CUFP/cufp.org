- speakers: Stefan Wehr, Emin Karayel

## Abstract
Haskell is a statically typed functional language with a robust and
feature-full compiler and a large set of high-quality libraries. This
tutorial shows you how to write Haskell programs that are ready for
the real world.

In this tutorial, we study the internals of a message-queue system
implemented in Haskell. Along the way, we will learn how to properly
deal with network programming, serialization, persistence, logging,
performance, scalability, testing, and concurrency. We start with a
very simple message-queue system. The participants will then extend
the system and add new features to it.

## Tutorial objectives
The tutorial teaches you important techniques for writing correct,
robust, scalable, and fast Haskell programs. The topics covered are:
network programming, serialization, persistence, logging, performance,
scalability, testing, and concurrency.

## Target audience
The tutorial aims at programmers with some Haskell experience. It is
not necessary to be an Haskell expert, but you should know how to
write functions and data types.

Participants should bring a laptop with the current version of the
Haskell platform (2013.2.0.0) installed. A list of additional packages
will be made available soon.
