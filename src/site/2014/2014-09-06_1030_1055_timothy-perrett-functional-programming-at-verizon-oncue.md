## Abstract 

Back in 2012, a team at Intel started working on a green-field project
to build a next-generation TV service from the ground up - everything
from the silicon to the service platform. From the very beginning the
platform was built using Scala and functional programming idioms. The
entire team was acquired by Verizon in early 2014 and we continue our
work on that very same service platform. This experience report
highlights how we grew our team from a small handful of engineers
doing functional programming to a well over a hundred engineers using
Scala every single day. This session also describes some of the
technical benefits and pitfalls our team encountered during the
process of building a large green-field system with Scala - where most
of the engineering staff were new to functional programming - and how
we went about edifying that large team on pure functional programming.
Finally, we'll cover some of the ways packaging functional APIs can
bridge the skills gap in large teams and ease the transition to FP
whilst still allowing teams to ship operational systems.
