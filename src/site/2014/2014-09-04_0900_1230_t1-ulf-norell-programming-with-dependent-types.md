- title: T1: Programming with Dependent Types
- speakers: Ulf Norell
- affiliations: Gothenburg University

## Abstract
Giving more precise types to your programs means that you get more
guarantees about their behaviour, but it also means that the type
checker has more information about your programs and can give you more
meaningful assistance during program development. In this tutorial I
will give you an introduction to Agda and show how to get the system
to work for you when writing dependently typed programs.

## Tutorial objectives
Learn how dependent types can help you when constructing programs.

## Target audience
People curious about dependent types.

Bring laptop with Agda installed (requires GHC and Emacs).

Ulf Norell has spent the last 10 years implementing the dependently
typed programming language Agda at Chalmers and Gothenburg University
and somehow managed to get a PhD in the process. He is currently
spending half his time on Agda development at the university and the
other half out in the real world doing property based testing using
QuickCheck for Quviq.
