- speakers: Torben Hoffmann 
- affiliations: Erlang Solutions Ltd 


## Abstract
While not a new concept, Embedded Linux is becoming more and more
popular with the barriers for entry being lowered by projects such as
the Raspberry Pi.

In this hands on tutorial we will design an Erlang powered embedded
sensor node, running on the Raspberry Pi. We will take you through the
steps required to build and deploy the Linux image, deal with hardware
interfacing and backend connectivity."

## Tutorial objectives
This tutorial will provide an overview of:

* Current tools and methodologies employed in embedded systems
* Embedded Linux and the ecosystem around it
* Hardware drivers and interfacing
* Erlang 101, focusing on features that are relevant to managing hardware
* Erlang/ALE framework for doing actor programming with Erlang for embedded systems

## Target audience
Engineers and programmers interested in designing the next generation
of embedded systems.

People need to bring their own laptop.

Instructions on what to prepare before coming will be provided.

Torben has been working with Erlang in Motorola and
Issuu as technical architect and developer since 2006. He has talked
about his Motorola achievements at Erlang eXchange 2008 and EUC 2010.
Before becoming an Erlanger he worked with software quality assurance,
process improvement and people management.

The first demo of Erlang to Motorola management was done on a little
Gumstix board anno 2006.
