## Abstract
QuickCheck support property based development. Instead of writing test
cases for your applications, you write a one-pager with a QuickCheck
property from which hundreds of test cases are generated
automatically.QuickCheck simplifies failing cases to a minimal example
on a test failure (so that fault diagnosis is quick and
easy). QuickCheck enables developers to dramatically improve test
coverage, and find obscure errors at an earlier stage, lowering costs
and improving quality as a result.

In this 180 minute tutorial we will use examples to show how
developers write QuickCheck specifications—which are actually Erlang
programs using the QuickCheck API—and use them to test code written in
Erlang or other programming languages. We will show how QuickCheck’s
shrinking finds tiny examples that provoke errors, making the step
from observing a bug to diagnosing it very short indeed, and we will
show how property driven development can produce code that is solid
from the word go.

John Hughes is co-founder and CEO of Quviq AB, and the originator of
Quviq QuickCheck. From 2002-2005 he led a major research project in
software verification, funded by the Swedish Strategic Research
Foundation. This led to the development of Quviq QuickCheck in
Erlang. Before John\'s involvement with Erlang, he was deeply involved
with the design of Haskell from the start, and co-chaired the
committee that defined the current language standard.
