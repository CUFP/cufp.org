- title: Some usages of functional programming for FO and quants
- speakers: Renaud Bechade

## Abstract 

Like many members of this audience, we’ve been using functional
programming in several places for several years. In our case, this
happened in finance institutions, in their front office.

FO users, traders and structures, fellow quants can be a hard public:
as we lived this adventure both as a trader/structurer and as a quant,
we can relate to conflicting goals and mindsets.

Our presentation will focus on the following key points: -
traders/structurers : what are their needs? ""why not do it all in
VBA?” - quantitative analysts : ""why not do it all in C++?"" what is
the upside? - how we planted seeds, how we failed (sometimes)

For each user category, we will illustrate some practical scenarios
where functional programming brought us added value, while trying to
share a realistic view of the bigger picture - support, non-FO IT,
audit…

Specifically, we will go though a few applications/frameworks we
developed, mainly, in Haskell and F# for both flow and structured
products across several asset classes: - pricers - market fitters &
injectors - strategy backtesting - market risk
