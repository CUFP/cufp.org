- title: T4: elm-d3: Front-end Development without Frameworks
- speakers: Spiros Eliopoulos
- affiliations: Cornell

## Abstract
elm-d3 makes it easy to create and architect declarative front-end
applications. By combining Elm’s FRP and D3’s data binding, it
improves on both. D3 code becomes modular and composable thanks to
Elm’s purity and static types. Elm gains a principled way of accessing
the DOM and leveraging HTML, SVG, and CSS. Their powers combined, you
can throw out your frameworks. After this tutorial, you will be
proficient enough with elm-d3 to easily create a widget that you can
integrate into any web application.


## Tutorial objectives
By the end of the tutorial, attendees will have implemented a basic
chart as well as a simple [Todo list application](http://todomvc.com/)
using the elm-d3 library. Building up to that, they will have learned:

* the meaning of the basic types and operators of elm-d3;
* how those concepts relate to those in D3; and
* how those concepts interact with Elm and its FRP runtime.

With those learnings in mind, attendees will be able go forth and
implement more sophisticated visualizations and applications using
elm-d3.

## Target audience
The target audience is commercial users who would like to use a
functional approach on the front-end. Whether you are frustrated with
JS or just exploring alternative approaches, you will get a lot out of
this. It is also valuable for academics interested in seeing FP used
to solve a very real practical problem.

NOTE: This tutorial is meant to form a series with the morning
[tutorial by Evan
Czaplicki](t3-evan-czaplicki-intro-to-elm-a-field-guide-for-functional-front-end-programming.html).

This tutorial requires the Elm Platform, the elm-d3 source code, and a
modern web browser. Documentation of the process can be found
[here](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform/blob/master/README.md#elm-platform). The
elm-d3 source code is available via
[GitHub](https://github.com/seliopou/elm-d3).
