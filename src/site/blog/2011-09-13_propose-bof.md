- title: Propose a BOF!
- categories: BOF

CUFP will again be having Bird-of-a-Feather sessions to discuss a variety of FP topics.  Last year's BOFs were a lot of fun, with topics ranging from meta-programming to packaging systems.

But we need you to help!  The BOFs only happen if people propose them.  Click [here](http://cufp.org/bofs-2011.html) to learn more about the BOFs and to find out how to propose a topic.
