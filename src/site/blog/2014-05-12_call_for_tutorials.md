- title: CUFP 2014 Call for Tutorials
- categories: 2014, cfp, tutorials, CUFP

Do you have what it takes to give a CUFP tutorial? If so, we want to
hear from you. Beginner and advanced subjects alike covering areas
which might interest commercial users of functional programming. We
are seeking proposals for half-day tutorials to be presented during
the first two days of the meeting, 4 and 5 September. Submission
deadline is May 30th, but the earlier you submit, the better! The 2014
call for tutorials is available at
[http://cufp.org/2014/call-for-tutorials.html](/2014/call-for-tutorials.html).

We look forward to hearing from you!
