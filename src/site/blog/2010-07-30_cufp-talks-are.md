- title: CUFP Talks are up
- categories: talks

The CUFP schedule is now complete!  Go [here](http://cufp.org/conference/schedule/2010.html) for a complete schedule, including both the talks and the tutorials.  You can also see the abstracts for the talks as well.

We had a really impressive set of submissions this year, and we had some very tough choices to make.  We definitely rejected talks that I would love to hear.  We're very proud of the list of talks we ended up with, and we're looking forward to a great workshop in October!
