- title: CUFP 2011 videos and scribe report now available
- categories: cufp2011

After a very successful CUFP 2011 in Tokyo, the videos are now available online in the [Videos \(tag: cufp2011\)](http://cufp.org/videos/keyword/2161.html) section. Thanks to Marius Eriksen's excellent scribe notes, we have also published a [formal report](http://journals.cambridge.org/repo_A85vaWut) summarising the event in the Journal of Functional Programming.

CUFP 2012 will be held in [Denmark](http://cufp.org/conference/2012.html), and the [Call for Presentations](http://cufp.org/cufp-2012-call-presentations.html) is still open until the 29th June!
