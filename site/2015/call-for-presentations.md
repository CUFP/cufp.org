The annual CUFP event is a place where people can see how others
are using functional programming to solve real world problems; where
practitioners meet and collaborate; where language designers and users
can share ideas about the future of their favorite language; and where
one can learn practical techniques and approaches for putting
functional programming to work.

## Giving a CUFP Talk

If you have experience using functional languages in a practical
setting, we invite you to submit a proposal to give a talk at the
event. We're looking for two kinds of talks:

**Experience reports** are typically 25 minutes long, and aim to
inform participants about how functional programming plays out in
real-world applications, focusing especially on lessons learnt and
insights gained. Experience reports don't need to be highly technical;
reflections on the commercial, management, or software engineering
aspects are, if anything, more important.

**Technical talks** are also 25 minutes long, and should focus on
teaching the audience something about a particular technique or
methodology, from the point of view of someone who has seen it play
out in practice. These talks could cover anything from techniques for
building functional concurrent applications, to managing dynamic
reconfigurations, to design recipes for using types effectively in
large-scale applications. While these talks will often be based on a
particular language, they should be accessible to a broad range of
programmers.

We strongly encourage submissions from people in communities that are
underrepresented in functional programming, including but not limited
to women; people of color; people in gender, sexual and romantic
minorities; people with disabilities; people residing in Asia, Africa,
or Latin America; and people who have never presented at a conference
before. We recognize that inclusion is an important part of our
mission to promote functional programming. So that CUFP can be a safe
environment in which participants openly exchange ideas, we abide by
the [SIGPLAN Conference Anti-Harassment
Policy](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Anti-harassment).

If you are interested in offering a talk, or nominating someone to do
so, please submit your presentation before 14 June 2015 via the

[CUFP 2015 Presentation Submission Form](http://goo.gl/forms/3KeXOSeoEJ)

You do not need to submit a paper, just a short proposal for your
talk. There will be a short scribe's report of the presentations and
discussions but not of the details of individual talks, as the meeting
is intended to be more of a discussion forum than a technical
interchange.

Nevertheless, presentations will be recorded and presenters will be
expected to sign an ACM copyright release form.

Note that we will need all presenters to register for the CUFP
workshop and travel to Vancouver at their own expense.

## More information
For more information on CUFP, including videos of presentations from
previous years, take a look at the CUFP website at
[http://cufp.org](/). Note that presenters, like other attendees, will
need to register for the event. Acceptance and rejection letters will 
be sent out by July 1st.


## Guidance on giving a great CUFP talk

**Focus on the interesting bits**: Think about what will distinguish
your talk, and what will engage the audience, and focus there. There
are a number of places to look for those interesting bits.

* **Setting**: FP is pretty well-established in some areas, including
  formal verification, financial processing, and server-side
  web services. An unusual setting can be a source of interest. If
  you're deploying FP-based mobile UIs or building servers on oil
  rigs, then the challenges of that scenario are worth focusing
  on. Did FP help or hinder in adapting to the setting?

* **Technology**: The CUFP audience is hungry to learn about how FP
  techniques work in practice. What design patterns have you applied,
  and to what areas? Did you use functional reactive programming for
  user interfaces, or DSLs for playing chess, or fault-tolerant actors
  for large-scale geological data processing?  Teach us something
  about the techniques you used, and why we should consider using them
  ourselves.

* **Getting things done**: How did you deal with large-scale software
  development in the absence of pre-existing support tools that
  are often expected in larger commercial environments (IDEs, coverage
  tools, debuggers, profilers) and without larger, proven bodies of
  libraries? Did you hit any brick walls that required support from
  the community?

* **Don't just be a cheerleader**: It's easy to write a rah-rah talk
  about how well FP worked for you, but CUFP is more interesting when
  the talks also cover what doesn't work. Even when the results were 
  all great, you should spend more time on the challenges along the way 
  than on the parts that went smoothly.
