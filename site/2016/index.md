**Functional Programming** has been at the forefront of a new
generation of programming technologies, and companies have been
successfully utilizing functional programming to enable more flexible,
robust, and effective software development.

The annual CUFP workshop is designed to serve the growing community of
commercial users of functional programming. Practitioners meet and
collaborate, language designers and users share ideas about the future
of their languages, and experts share their expertise on practical
functional programming.

CUFP is co-located with [ICFP](http://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-2016)
and consists of two components: Talks and Tutorials.

###### Saturday September 24th
Talks are by expert practitioners and will be split between experience reports,
describing ways in which functional programming has been used, either
successfully or unsuccessfully, in the real world; and technical
talks, which will detail techniques and approaches for applying
functional programming in practical settings.
