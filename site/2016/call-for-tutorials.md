# CUFP 2016 Call for Tutorials

Commercial Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) is an annual meeting
co-located with the International Conference on Functional Programming which
this year will take place in Nara, Japan from the 22nd to 24th of September
2016.

CUFP aims to bridge the gap between academia and users applying functional
programming in practice. CUFP provides high-quality practical tutorials covering
state-of-the-art techniques and tools for functional programming. There will be
a mix of tutorials on introduction and advanced level, such that anyone that
wants to learn something new has an opportunity to do so.

We are seeking proposals for half-day tutorials to be presented during the first
two days of the meeting, 22nd and 24th of September. Submission deadline is June
26th, but the earlier you submit, the better!

Among the suggested topics for tutorials are:

* Introductions to functional programming languages. In the past we have had
  introductions to Clojure, Erlang, F#, F*, Haskell, ML, OCaml, Scala, Scheme
  and others.

* Advanced programming languages concepts and applications, such as Lens, Agda,
  Idris and others

* Applying functional programming in particular areas, including the web
  (Servant), high-performance computing, finance.

* Tools and techniques supporting state of the art functional programming. In
  the past we have had tutorials on QuickCheck, Elm and others.


Tutorial proposals should address the following points:

* Title

* Abstract (about 200 words) including

   * Tutorial Objectives: by the end of this tutorial you will be able to …

   * Intended audience: e.g. beginners, those with a working knowledge of X, …

   * Speaker Bio: Joe Bloggs is ...

   * Infrastructure required: For example, will participants need access to a
     particular system? Do they need to download anything prior to the tutorial?
     Can they be expected to have this on a laptop, or does it need to be
     provided by the meeting?

   * Other minor information which will help us market your tutorial.

Tutorials should be submitted using the following talk submission form. Deadline
for submission is June 26, 2016. Notification of acceptance is two weeks later.

Tutorial Agreement

While CUFP does not pay tutors, they will be compensated with admission credits
to CUFP and ICFP, as outlined below.

- If a tutorial has 5 or more registrants, the tutor will receive free admission
  to CUFP, including the two days of tutorials and the day of the CUFP workshop.

- If a tutorial has 10 or more registrants, the tutorialist will additionally
  receive a $250 voucher that can be used to register for any of the other ICFP
  events, including ICFP itself.

Note that we reserve the right to cancel tutorials with fewer than 5
registrants, but we will try hard to avoid having to do so. No compensation will
be awarded for cancelled tutorials.
