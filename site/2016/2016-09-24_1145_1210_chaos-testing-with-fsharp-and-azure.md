## Abstract 

Some of the biggest growing pains we've experienced with our microservice architecture at Jet is in preparing for system outages. I'll start with an overview of the benefits of choosing F# specifically, and functional programming in general, as well as Azure, for a chaos program. I'll follow up with a discussion of why your team needs to implement a chaos testing program, and finish with showing off our methods and code in depth.
