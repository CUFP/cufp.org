- title: PureScript Front-end Developement
- speakers: Brian McKenna

## Abstract
PureScript is a small, typed, functional programming language which compiles to JavaScript. Some of the goals are to require no runtime by compiling to minimal JavaScript and to provide a simple Foreign Function Interface to interact with existing JavaScript. PureScript has seen some commercial adoption and has many libraries available for writing functional web front-ends.

This tutorial will cover writing an interactive web application using PureScript.

## Tutorial objectives
1. Write a front-end web application using pure functions.
2. Learn some of the many tools used for writing PureScript applications.
3. Use the FFI to interact with existing JavaScript.

## Target audience
People with some experience in typed functional programming interested in applying their skills to front-end development. Possibly useful to people interested in finding out how to express front-ends as pure functions.

## Infrastructure Required
A workspace in the Cloud9 online IDE will be provided with all required tools configured. It's possible to use any other system as long as the PureScript compiler and node.js are installed.

## Speaker Bio
Brian McKenna has worked with web development for 8 years and has commercial experience with PureScript in creating an open-source front-end to SlamData. Brian has contributed to the PureScript compiler and many PureScript libraries.
