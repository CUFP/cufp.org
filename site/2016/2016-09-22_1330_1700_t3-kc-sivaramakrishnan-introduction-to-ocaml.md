- title: T3: Introduction to OCaml
- speakers: “KC” Sivaramakrishnan

## Abstract
OCaml is a general purpose industrial-strength functional programming language with an emphasis on expressiveness and safety. In this tutorial, we will first introduce the basics of OCaml using an interactive environment running in a web browser, before moving on to building an interactive game.

## Tutorial objectives
This tutorial aims to give an introduction to the OCaml language. Attendees should leave feeling comfortable writing simple OCaml programs and using core OCaml tools.

## Target audience
This tutorial is aimed at people with programming experience. Previous experience with a functional language will be useful but is not required. No prior knowledge of OCaml is assumed.

## Infrastructure Required
Participants should bring their own laptop
