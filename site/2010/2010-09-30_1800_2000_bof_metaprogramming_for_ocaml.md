*Topic*: Get together some of the many people who are thinking about
meta-programming in OCaml.  There are a bunch of different approaches
at present:

- camlp4, proponents including Nicolas Pouillard and Jake Donham
- BER Metocaml, by Oleg, Jacques Carette and Walid Taha
- An unnamed idea of having the toolchain keep track of annotations,
  that could be used by post-processing tools that directly manipulate
  the OCaml AST, proponents including Alain Frisch.

Minsky, Chung-chieh Shan, Oleg, Nicolas Pouillard, Thomas Gazagnaire,
