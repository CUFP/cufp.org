*Topic*: where we as a community should be focusing our efforts over
the coming year to continue to improve Haskell as a practical language
for day-to-day hacking.

Subjects we expect to cover would include at least the following:

- post-mortem crash analysis and debugging
- improvements to the Cabal build system \(e.g. parallel builds\)
- performance and documentation improvements for core libraries
- plugging missing functionality holes in the family of packages on
  hackage
