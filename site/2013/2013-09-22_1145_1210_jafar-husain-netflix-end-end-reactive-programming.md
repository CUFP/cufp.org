## Abstract

What is the difference between a database query and drag-and-drop
event? The answer: nothing. They're both queries, and can be coded
using the exact same programming model.  A newly discovered type has
given us new insight into the dual relationship between synchronous
and asynchronous programming. You'll be surprised to learn that the
sequence operations you already know \(map, filter, reduce, merge,
zip, etc.\) can to be used to build everything from GUIs to high
performance, non-blocking servers.  Come see how Netflix uses
functional composition over this amazing new type to build reactive
multi-tier systems. You may never approach reactive programming the
same way again.
