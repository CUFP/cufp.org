## Abstract
Twitter's Summingbird library allows developers and data scientists to
build massive streaming MapReduce pipelines without worrying about the
usual mess of systems issues that come with scale. This talk will
discuss our experience applying functional programming ideas and
techniques to the development of the Summingbird library, the power of
clean, mathematical abstractions and the massive creative leverage
that functional design constraints can give to a project.  The talk
will also discuss the various Scala libraries that were created to
support Summingbird \(most prominently, Algebird, Bijection, Chill and
Storehaus\) and some of the applications for these technologies
currently being used at Twitter.

## Sam Ritchie
is a developer on Twitter's revenue team and the author of a number of
successful open source Scala and Clojure projects including Algebird,
Storehaus, Bijection.
