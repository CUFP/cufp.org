## Abstract
Functional programming is already an established technology is many
areas. However, the lack of skilled developers has been a challenging
hurdle in the adoption of such languages. It is easy for an
inexperienced programmer to fall into the many traps of functional
programming, resulting in a loss of productivity and bad software
quality. Resource leaks caused by Haskell's lazy evaluation, for
instance, are only the tip of the iceberg. Knowledge sharing and a
mature tool-assisted development process are ways to avoid such
pitfalls.  At GREE, one of the largest mobile gaming companies, we use
Haskell and Scala to develop major components of our platform, such as
a distributed NoSQL solution, or an image storage
infrastructure. However, only 11 programmers use functional
programming on their daily task.  In this talk, we will describe some
unexpected functional programming issues we ran into, how we solved
them and how we hope to avoid them in the future. We have developed a
system testing framework to enhance regression testing, spent lots of
time documenting pitfalls and introduced technical reviews. Recently,
we even started holding lunchtime presentations about functional
programming in order to attract beginners and prevent them from
falling into the same traps.
