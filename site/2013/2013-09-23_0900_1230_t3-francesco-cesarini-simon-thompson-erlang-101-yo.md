- title: T3: Erlang 101 - Your introduction to Concurrency and Multi-core
- speakers: Francesco Cesarini, Simon Thompson


## Abstract
Erlang’s basic features are a perfect match for massively concurrent,
distributed cloud environments. Being rooted in an actor model with no
shared memory, the complexity of multicore programming is hidden from
the developers, allowing them to focus on the program. This tutorial
will introduce Erlang and its actor model, explaining how it is
positioning itself to win the multicore challenge.  Basic &amp;
Sequential Erlang  This section deals with Erlang data types and
pattern matching. Functions, and modules are discussed. It continues
by introducing recursion, with a special emphasis on different
recursive patterns, including tail recursion.  Concurrent Programming 
This section describes the creation of processes and their life
span. It looks at sending and receiving messages, selective reception,
and passing data in the messages. It continues with the various uses
of time outs and registering processes, and terminates by showing the
generic process code structure. We conclude this section by
introducing the simple but powerful error handling mechanisms in
processes. It looks at process links, exit signals and their
propagation semantics.  Multicore Programming This section guides the
users through examples and scalability issues when writing programs
you expect to double in speed when doubling your cores. It covers
tools and programming techniques you can use to detect and avoid
bottlenecks.

In order to get the most out of this tutorial, you must have a good
grasp of other programming languages. Having dabbled with
[http://tryerlang.org](http://tryerlang.org) is not necessary, but
will help. This is a hands-on tutorial.

Before arriving, download and install Erlang and get the Erlang mode
for your favorite editor working. Erlang \(source or binaries\) can be
downloaded at
[https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp). Erlang
is supported in most editors, including Emacs, VIM, Intellij, Eclipse,
Sublime and others.

## Francesco Cesarini
Francesco Cesarini is the founder of [Erlang Solutions
Ltd](https://www.erlang-solutions.com). He has used Erlang on a daily
basis since 1995, starting as an intern at Ericsson’s computer science
laboratory, the birthplace of Erlang. He moved on to Ericsson’s Erlang
training and consulting arm working on the first release of the OTP
middleware, applying it to turnkey solutions and flagship telecom
applications. In 1999, soon after Erlang was released as open source,
he founded Erlang Solutions. With offices in three countries, they
have become the world leaders in Erlang based support, consulting,
training, certification, systems development and
conferences. Francesco has worked in major Erlang based projects both
within and outside Ericsson, and as Technical Director, has led the
development and consulting teams at Erlang Solutions. He is also the
co-author of Erlang Programming, a book recently published by O’Reilly
and lectures at Oxford University and the IT University of
Gothenburg. You can follow his ramblings on

Computing of the University of Kent, where he has taught computing at
undergraduate and postgraduate levels for the past twentyeight years,
and where he was formerly department head for seven years and is
currently Director of Research and Enterprise. His research focusses
on building tools for more effective programming, including the
Wrangler refactorer for Erlang.
