- title: C6: Transducers in Practice
- speakers: Renzo Borgatti

## Abstract
Transducers is a powerful functional abstraction included with Clojure, a popular dialect of Lisp that runs on the JVM. They are generally
faster, more reusable and composable than other functions for collection processing. This tutorial, after introducing the functional
foundations, presents real-world examples and best practices. The lab at the end of each section should give you an opportunity to
practice what weâ€™ve learned.

## Tutorial objectives
Attendees will work on an example project using Clojure Transducers. We'll see debugging techniques, custom transducers and how to use them in parallel on multiple cores. The tutorial is structured to enable attendees to understand transducers and use them in their project.

## Target audience
This tutorial is aimed at people with basic Clojure understanding. Previous experience with a functional language is also useful but not required.

## Infrastructure required
Participants should bring their laptop. The tutorial files will be distributed at the beginning of the session, including slides and labs. Please sign up mailing list clojure-workshop@googlegroups.com so that your question before or after tutorial will be answered by the tutors.
