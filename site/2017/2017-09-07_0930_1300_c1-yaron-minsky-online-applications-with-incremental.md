- title: C1: Online Applications with Incremental
- speakers: Yaron Minsky and Sebastian Funk

## Abstract
Incremental is a library aimed at making it easier to write on-line algorithms,
i.e. , algorithms that can efficiently respond to new input data without having
to redo the entire computation from scratch. This kind of problem comes up in
many circumstances including data-driven UIs or complex modeling based on
real-time data. In this tutorial we'll focus on building a monitoring application
with Incremental based on a rapidly changing data set. We will look at techniques
that allow you to build efficient views of this data to represent various aspects
of the system being monitored.

## Tutorial objectives
Participants will be walked through a number of different aspects of the
Incremental API, including the core monadic calculus as well as specialized
time-based computations and computations over diffable data structures like maps.

## Target audience
Some familiarity with OCaml and the basic toolchain will be helpful, though anyone
with a solid understanding of statically typed functional languages should be
able to participate.

## Infrastructure required
Participants will need a computer with OCaml and OPAM installed.
