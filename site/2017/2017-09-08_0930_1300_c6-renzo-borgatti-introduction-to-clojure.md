- title: C6: Introduction to Clojure
- speakers: Renzo Borgatti

## Abstract
Clojure is a popular dialect of Lisp that runs on the JVM. Clojure has a robust concurrency system, state of the art immutable data structures, Java-like comparable performances, macros and much more. This tutorial is an introduction to Clojure and some related functional programming concepts. The lab at the end of each section should give you an opportunity to practice what we've learned.

## Tutorial objectives
Attendees will be able to setup a basic project, learn about the functional concepts present in Clojure, try out data structures and some basic macros. The tutorial is structured to offer attendees the basic understanding necessary to start experimenting on their own.

## Target audience
This tutorial is aimed at people with programming experience but not necessarily functional. Previous experience with a functional language is useful but not required. No prior knowledge of Clojure is assumed.

## Infrastructure required
Participants should bring their laptop with a copy of VirtualBox installed (free download from https://www.virtualbox.org). The tutorial is distributed as an image which provides all the necessary setup to start working, including slides and labs. The image will be provided at the beginning of the session.
