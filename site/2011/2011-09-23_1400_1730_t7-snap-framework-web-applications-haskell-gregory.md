- speakers: Gregory Collins

## Abstract
The Snap Framework is a fast and easy to use library for writing web
applications in Haskell. This hands-on code lab will guide
participants in using Snap to create a simple web application in
Haskell from start to finish.

## Audience
Some familiarity with Haskell is required: If you've read and
understand "Learn You a Haskell" and have started in on "Real World
Haskell", that's enough.

## Preparation
Before attending, participants should have a copy of the Haskell framework,
as per the instructions that come with tutorial [T5: Parallel Programming in Haskell](/2011/t5-parallel-programming-haskell-simon-peyton-jones.html).

You will also need the Snap framework, which you can install via this command:

<code>cabal install snap</code>

Moreover, download the tutorial code which will be available by September 11
[here](https://github.com/snapframework/cufp2011) \- either click the
big "Download" button or follow the instructions for cloning the Git
repository.
