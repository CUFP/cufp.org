Functional programming languages have been a hot topic of academic
research for over 35 years, and they have seen an ever larger
practical impact in settings ranging from tech startups to financial
firms to biomedical research labs. At the same time, a vigorous
community of working programmers employing functional languages has
come into existence.

CUFP is designed to serve this community. The annual CUFP workshop is
a place where people can see how others are using functional
programming to solve real world problems; where practitioners meet and
collaborate; where language designers and users can share ideas about
the future of their favorite language; and where one can learn
practical techniques and approaches for putting functional programming
to work.

CUFP 2011 will feature two days of tutorials given by language
experts, on the 22nd and 23rd, and a day of talks on the 24th.
Attendees may register for any subset of the days.

There will be no published proceedings, as the meeting is intended to
be more a discussion forum than a technical interchange, but videos of
all the talks will be placed online after the event.
