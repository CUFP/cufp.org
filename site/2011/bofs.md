# BoFs 2011

Following last year's success, [CUFP 2011](/2011/) will again include
Birds of a Feather sessions. BoFs provide a place for our community to
gather informally at CUFP and reach consensus on matters of
importance. Any CUFP attendee can propose a BoF session, and grab one
of the spare rooms in the evening slots below. Attendance in the
evening is open to all.

BoF sessions facilitate ad-hoc discussions and provide a place to
gather and start off the chat, before moving on during the evening to
a local restaurant or pub. There is no deadline for proposing a
session, but we encourage you to do so at the earliest possible time
to help us with planning and to publicize your proposed
discussion. Attendees are also free to show up even if you have not
confirmed, but again earlier confirmation will help us with planning.

To propose a BoF, please mail Ashish Agarwal (agarwal1975 (at) gmail
dot com) with the following information:

- Organiser contact name, email address and \(optionally\) cell phone
  number to get a hold of you on the day.
- Which day you wish to book.
- Number of attendees expected \(to help plan room capacities\).
- Title of your discussion and a few sentences describing the topic,
  for posting below.
- If you are willing to sponsor the BoF with some beer and snacks,
  that would also be appreciated, and you can include the sponsor's
  name.

If you wish to attend a session, please also email Ashish Agarwal
(agarwal1975 (at) gmail dot com) and you will be added to the attendee
list so we can more easily account for numbers. You don't have to do
this though; feel free to show up on the day!

*Note:* CUFP Tutorials end at 5:30 PM, and the BoFs follow them after
a break. Rooms are available till 9:00 PM but we encourage you to wrap
up by 8:00 PM and move the discussion to a more social setting.
