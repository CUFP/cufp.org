## Abstract
Over the years I've both used Haskell a lot commercially and also made four Haskell implementations.
Of the four implementations three are very non-standard because they were aimed for particular targets.
I will talk about various aspects of using and implementing non-standard Haskell as well as show a number of examples from my latest Haskell implementation which is strict.  I will also make a pragmatic assessment of strict versus lazy.
