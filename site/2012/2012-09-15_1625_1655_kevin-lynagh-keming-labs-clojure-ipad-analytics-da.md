## Abstract
ClojureScript, a Clojure to JavaScript complier, brings
rich, functional semantics to browsers and mobile platforms, providing
a versatile foundation for graphical, interactive applications. In
this talk, I will  discuss using state machines with data-driven
DOM-manipulation to build visual applications on the web and iPad. In
particular, I will cover how to handle the necessary mutable state of
an interactive application within a immutable, functional
environment. Concrete examples will be drawn from data visualization
applications in the energy and biotech fields.

## Kevin Lynagh
Kevin visualizes data and makes statistical interfaces on the
web. Before Clojure, he wrote machine learning and analytics tools in
R and Scala. In 2010 he wrote a thesis on protein structure, for which
Reed College inexplicably awarded him a physics degree. Kevin lives in
Portland, Oregon, and spends as much time rock climbing as he does in
the REPL. You can find more about him in his [github repository](http://github.com/lynaghk).
