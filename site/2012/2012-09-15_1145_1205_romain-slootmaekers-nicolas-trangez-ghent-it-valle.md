## Abstract
In 2009 \(Q3\), Amplidata\(then called B-Virtual\) decided to use Ocaml to
implement version 2.0 of their dispersed storage system \(DSS\). A deci-
sion taken at the right moment: The development of the 1.6 version had
completely stalled: bugs galore, new features too difficult to add,
and the whole development team cranky. I \(Romain Slootmaekers\) seized
the opportunity and offered to rewrite one of the components in the
distributed system in Ocaml. 1.5 days later, a drop-in replacement for
the component in question was demoed, fullfilling the
promise. Together with the argument that if you do what everybody else
does, you will get comparable results \(not a very desirable outcome
for a startup\), this convinced upper management. Several years down
the road, we can look back.

## Romain Slootmaekers
Romain Slootmaekers is a computer scientist \(ir cw, KULeuven\)
with interests in all facets of software development strategy and a
special attraction towards the algorithmic challenges of distributed
computing.

While being a Research team lead at A-Server, he discovered that
Telecom and Storage are in fact the same \(Storage being a very high
latency telecom\),
an insight which led to a new class of storage now systems being
productised by Amplidata.

He has the strong conviction programming languages should be part of
the solution, not part of the problem.
