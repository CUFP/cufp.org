# CUFP 2012 Registration

You can register on the [ICFP registration
page](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2012/registration.html), which has
both online and offline options.  CUFP consists of three separate
days, each of which can be registered for individually. The prices for
individual days range from $100 to $250, depending on various
discounts that are detailed on the page. For the first time, CUFP also
features *introductory tutorials* for which special registration
options apply; for those, see below. For regular registration, do
this:

- Thu 13th September 2012: Tutorials Day 1, select the *Thursday Pass*
  and the tutorials you plan to attend \(see below\).

- Fri 14th September 2012: Tutorials Day 2, select the *Friday Pass*
  and the tutorials you plan to attend \(see below\).

- Sat 15th September 2012: Conference Day, select the *Saturday Pass*


## Introductory Tutorials on Scala, F\#, Haskell
We'll have three *introductory tutorials* on:

- Thu 13th September 2012:
  [Scala](/2012/scala-primer-heiko-seeberger-typesafe.html)

- Fri 14th September 2012:
  [F\#](/2012/functional-concepts-real-world-f-tomas-petricek-un.html)

- Thu-Fri 13-14th September 2012:
  [Haskell](/2012/introductory-haskell-concurrent-haskell-jeremy-gib-day1.html)

by renowned experts on those languages. These tutorials are intended
for participants mostly new to functional programming, and will give
in-depth training on those languages.

These introductory tutorials all go for a full day, and in the case of
Haskell, for *two days*.  These tutorials require *separate, specific
registration* for regular attendees, so be sure to select the
appropriate box when you register.  You will not need a day pass if
you register for one of these full-day tutorials.

\(Registration for introductory tutorials includes day passes for the
days of the tutorials: Note, however, that you will miss part of the
tutorial if you choose to attend any other events.\)

*If you are a student* and would like to attend an introductory
 tutorial, you can check during the conference registration whether
 slots are available, and if so, you can get in on a regular day pass.


## Regular Tutorials
There will also be in-depth technical tutorials for attendees already
familiar with a functional language:

- *Thu Sep 13th 2012 am*: [Real World OCaml
   \(T1\)](/2012/t1-real-world-ocaml-anil-madhavapeddy-university-c.html)

- *Thu Sep 13th 2012 pm*: [Erlang Web
   \(T2\)](/2012/t2-erlang-web-frameworks-steve-vinoski-basho-techn.html)

- *Fri Sep 14th 2012 am*: [Haskell Web
   \(T3\)](/2012/t3-haskell-lazy-web-developer-introduction-happsta.html)

- *Fri Sep 14th 2012 pm*: [Clojure
   \(T4\)](/2012/t4-hands-real-world-clojure-lau-jensen-best-class-.html)

They have designations T1 through T4 on the [CUFP
schedule](/2012/index.html#Day1ThuSep13thTutorials). If you want to attend any of those,
just purchase a regular day pass for the day of the tutorial.
