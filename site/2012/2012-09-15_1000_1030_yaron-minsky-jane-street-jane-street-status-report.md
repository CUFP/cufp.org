## Abstract
Jane Street is a proprietary trading company that has been using OCaml
as its primary development language for nearly a decade. In those
years, both the firm and the firm's technology stack have grown and
matured. This talk will describe that evolution, and discuss the role
that OCaml plays at Jane Street today.
